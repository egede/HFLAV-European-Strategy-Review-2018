% Correct Bibtex entries are best obtained by cut-and-paste from 
% Spires or Inspire. 
% - They might still need some editing of Latex symbols in 
%   the titles. 
% - Page ranges should in many cases be shortened to just 
%   having the start page.
% - Collaborations might need to be added or indeed just the word 
%   "collaboration" put after them.
