\noindent The Heavy Flavor Averaging Group (HFLAV)~\cite{HFLAV16} was formed in 2002 to 
continue the activities of the LEP Heavy Flavor Steering 
Group~\cite{Abbaneo:2000ej_mod,*Abbaneo:2001bv_mod_cont}. 
The group is responsible for calculating averages of measurements of beauty- and charm-hadron properties from all experiments around the globe. With this perspective, the members of HFLAV are well 
placed to comment on the future importance of flavour physics. \textbf{In this submission we make the argument for support of heavy-flavour physics in both the near term and the far future. Specific recommendations are in bold.}

In the next decade, the majority of new $b$-physics measurements will come from the \lhcb and \belletwo experiments. Following upgrade~I, \lhcb will benefit from unprecedently large samples of all types of $b$-hadrons, and \belletwo will produce $B$-meson pairs with well known kinematics from the initial state. To give an example of their complementarity, \lhcb will provide the most accurate measurements of angular distributions in exclusive electroweak-penguin decays with charged leptons, while \belletwo will perform the corresponding inclusive studies and will measure the branching fractions of the related decays $\decay{\Bz}{\Kstarz \neu\neub}$. The combination of these results places very strong limits on the nature of physics involving new couplings to leptons, much more than the individual measurements. \textbf{The dual approach of conducting heavy-flavour physics in both the controlled} $\bm{\ep \en}$ \textbf{environment and in the much higher statistics hadronic environment should be supported into the future.}

Precision flavor-physics measurements at the
\tevatron demonstrated the potential of hadron-collider experiments in this area. Following this initial success, the \lhcb experiment pushed the boundaries of what can be done at a hadron collider well beyond its original goals.
Given the current results on flavor physics and energy-frontier physics, the case for probing new physics in heavy-flavour decays is stronger than ever. \lhcb upgrade~II~\cite{LHCb-PII-Physics} is proposing to create an experiment that will be able to collect data at a luminosity twice that of upgrade~I. This will lead to large jumps in the sensitivity in key areas, such as \CP violation in the charm and beauty systems, angular observables in penguin decays, and the study of lepton universality. The explored mass scale will grow by close to a factor two relative to that of the upgrade~I program. The theoretical uncertainties related to the measurements are under control in all key channels. \textbf{Support for the construction of 
\lhcb upgrade II and its exploitation though the complete high luminosity \lhc period is essential.}

Measurements conducted in the past few years have raised the question of whether semileptonic $b$-hadron decays are purely governed by SM physics. 
In particular, \lhcb measurements of the
angular distribution in $\decay{\Bd}{\Kstarz\mup\mun}$, as well as the ratios $R_{K^{(*)}}$ between the branching fractions of the decays $\decay{B}{K^{(\ast)}\mup\mun}$ and $\decay{B}{K^{(\ast)}\ep\en}$, are in tension with the SM predictions, suggesting potential new physics in particular Wilson coefficients. Tensions exist also in the ratios of branching fractions of $b\to c\tau\nu$ decays. This has  led to a large number of models that introduce new flavor-violating gauge bosons or leptoquarks. 
%The explosion in the searches for direct production of these new particles within \atlas and \cms in the last few years have illustrated how heavy flavour physics informs and motivates the search for new physics through the direct production of new states. 
Constraints from flavor physics indicate that direct detection of these states at LHC will be difficult or impossible, while a 100\tev $pp$ hadron collider would be able to discover these particles in the majority of parameter space of the proposed models~\cite{Allanach:2017bta}. This demonstrates the role of flavor physics in informing future energy-frontier facilities. 
\textbf{It is imperative that planning of new facilities include consideration of the ways in which heavy-flavour 
physics can be further explored there.} 
For a future circular collider, this could be via collection of a large number of $e^+e^-\to Z$ events, as well as a $pp$ flavour-physics experiment along the
lines of \lhcb.
%, a fixed target facility, 
The abundance of measurements that have
been carried out at \lhcb makes it clear that \textbf{at a hadron collider, there is a huge advantage to having a
dedicated flavour-physics experiment with optimised detector and trigger, rather than running a flavour-physics programme as a parasitic activity of a high} $\bm \pt$ \textbf{experiment.}

The strategy of particle physics is not only about which new facilities should be funded but also about funding
the research to be carried out at those facilities. Across Europe there are 61 groups involved in heavy flavour
physics on the \lhcb experiment, YY on the \belletwo experiment, 17 on the \besiii experiment, and a
significant number on \atlas and \cms. In addition to this there is a large number
of theory groups working on the phenomenology of heavy flavour decays. The data analyses in these
experiments are 
often performed in relatively small groups at universities and government labs and can take multiple 
years to
finish due to their high complexity. The analyses also typically involve detailed and specific collaboration
with phenomenologists in terms of obtaining information that is optimised for interpretation. 
For these reasons
the long term support of the experimental and theoretical groups involved in flavour physics is an essential
part of exploiting the investment in the facilities and associated experiments. \textbf{The European strategy should make it clear
that supporting particle physics is not only a matter of supporting CERN and other global laboratories 
but also about supporting the individual experimental and theoretical research groups.}
